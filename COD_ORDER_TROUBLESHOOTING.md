# COD Order Troubleshooting Guide

## Your Implementation Status ✅

Your current implementation is **CORRECT** and follows Shopify's best practices:

1. ✅ Using `draftOrderCreate` followed by `draftOrderComplete`
2. ✅ Explicitly setting `financialStatus: "PENDING"` for COD orders
3. ✅ Specifying `paymentGateway: "Cash on Delivery"`
4. ✅ Enhanced error logging for troubleshooting
5. ✅ Proper order validation and completion

## If Orders Still Don't Appear

### 1. Check Shopify Admin Settings
- Go to **Settings > Payments** in your Shopify admin
- Ensure **Cash on Delivery** is enabled and active
- Verify the payment method is not archived or disabled

### 2. Verify App Permissions
- Check your app has `orders` or `write_orders` scope
- Confirm the app is properly installed and authenticated

### 3. Search for Orders
- In Shopify admin, search by:
  - Customer email address
  - Order number (format: #1001, #1002, etc.)
  - Date range when order was created
- Check if orders are filtered out by status or date

### 4. Check Order Status
- Look in **Orders** section (not Draft Orders)
- Verify financial status shows as "Pending"
- Check fulfillment status

### 5. Review Logs
Your enhanced implementation now logs:
- Draft order creation response
- Draft order completion response
- Order visibility validation
- Financial and fulfillment status

### 6. Common Issues
- **Archived Draft Orders**: Cannot be completed
- **Theme Interference**: Custom themes might hide orders
- **Third-party Apps**: May interfere with order display
- **Filter Settings**: Orders might be hidden by filters

## Testing Your Implementation

1. Submit a test COD order
2. Check server logs for the enhanced logging output
3. Search for the order in Shopify admin using the order number
4. Verify the order appears in the main Orders page (not Draft Orders)

## Expected Log Output
