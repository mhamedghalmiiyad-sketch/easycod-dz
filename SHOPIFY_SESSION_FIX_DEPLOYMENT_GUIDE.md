# üöÄ Shopify Session Fix - Complete Deployment Guide

This guide provides the exact steps to fix the Shopify session redirect loop issue on Render.

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

1. **SESSION_SECRET Runtime Check** - Added validation to ensure SESSION_SECRET is present at runtime
2. **Trust Proxy Setting** - Added `app.set("trust proxy", 1)` for Render HTTPS termination
3. **PrismaSessionStorage Verification** - Confirmed and added logging for Prisma session storage
4. **Debug Logging** - Added comprehensive logging for session creation and authentication
5. **Database URL Format** - Instructions to ensure proper SSL and port configuration

## üîß Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Generate SESSION_SECRET

Run this command locally to generate a secure session secret:

```bash
node scripts/generate-session-secret.js
```

Copy the generated secret value.

### 2. Update Render Environment Variables

Go to your Render service dashboard ‚Üí Environment tab and add/update these variables:

```
SESSION_SECRET=<paste_the_generated_secret_here>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://easycod_dz_db_user:9K8hnx0GqxEAfh6pDkjTOufnOhd8iXNk@dpg-d3m1uh7diees73a95f2g-a:5432/easycod_dz_db?sslmode=require
```

**Important**: Make sure the DATABASE_URL includes `:5432` and `?sslmode=require`

### 3. Deploy the Updated Code

The following files have been updated with fixes:

- `server.js` - Added SESSION_SECRET check and trust proxy setting
- `app/shopify.server.ts` - Added session storage verification logging
- `app/routes/auth.$.tsx` - Added comprehensive auth debugging

Deploy these changes to Render.

### 4. Verify the Fix

After deployment, check your Render logs for these success messages:

```
‚úÖ SESSION_SECRET is present and loaded (length: 64)
‚úÖ Express trust proxy enabled for Render HTTPS termination
‚úÖ Shopify session storage initialized with PrismaSessionStorage
üß† Using Prisma session storage ‚Äî verifying persistence...
```

### 5. Test the Authentication Flow

1. Go to your Shopify admin
2. Click on your app
3. Check the Render logs for these debug messages:

```
--- AUTH CALLBACK START ---
ENV SESSION_SECRET present? true
ENV SHOPIFY_APP_URL https://easycod-dz-1.onrender.com
Session created/retrieved: { id: '...', shop: '...', isOnline: false }
Authentication successful - session persisted
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If SESSION_SECRET is missing:
```
‚ùå SESSION_SECRET is missing at runtime!
```
**Fix**: Add SESSION_SECRET to Render environment variables and redeploy.

### If you still see redirect loops:
1. Check that all success messages appear in logs
2. Verify DATABASE_URL format includes `:5432` and `?sslmode=require`
3. Check that `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` exactly matches your Render URL
4. Ensure OAuth redirect URLs in Shopify Partner Dashboard match your app

### If sessions aren't being created:
Look for these error messages in logs:
```
Session creation/retrieval error: [error details]
```
This will help identify the specific issue.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] SESSION_SECRET generated and added to Render
- [ ] DATABASE_URL updated with `:5432` and `?sslmode=require`
- [ ] Code changes deployed to Render
- [ ] Success messages visible in logs
- [ ] Authentication flow tested

## üéØ Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:

1. **No more redirect loops** - Users can successfully authenticate
2. **Sessions persist** - Authentication state is maintained across requests
3. **Proper cookie handling** - Cookies work correctly behind Render's proxy
4. **Database persistence** - Sessions are stored in the `_Session` table

## üîß Technical Details

### Trust Proxy Setting
```js
app.set("trust proxy", 1);
```
This tells Express it's behind a trusted proxy (Render), enabling secure cookies over HTTPS.

### Session Storage
```ts
sessionStorage: new PrismaSessionStorage(db)
```
Uses Prisma to persist sessions in the database instead of memory.

### Cookie Configuration
The Shopify library automatically sets cookies with:
- `Secure=true` (HTTPS only)
- `SameSite=None` (iframe embedding)
- `HttpOnly=true` (XSS protection)

## üìû Support

If you continue to experience issues after following this guide:

1. Check Render logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Shopify Partner Dashboard settings match your app URL
4. Test with Chrome (not Firefox) for embedded app flows
