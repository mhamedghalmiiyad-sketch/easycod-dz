3. Check if session exists in database for the shop
4. Reinstall the app if necessary

### If 404 Error Persists:
1. Verify app proxy configuration in Shopify Partner dashboard
2. Check that `subpath = "proxy"` and `prefix = "apps"` are correct
3. Ensure your tunnel/domain is accessible
4. Update app proxy URL if using a new tunnel

### If Build Error Persists:
1. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
2. Clear build cache: `rm -rf build`
3. Restart development server
